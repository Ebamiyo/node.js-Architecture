Monolithic architecture: This is a traditional model of software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications.

Microservices: This is a software architectural model that relies on a series of independently deployable services. Instead of a single unit doing all the work, the processes of the unit are broken down to independently runb as services. They make any complexity visible and more manageable as they are smaller processesthat function independently of eachother and contribute to the overall whole.

The Microservices Architecture appeals to me. It allows easy management of the processes. It is easier to see what is going on. Updates needed for some parts of the overall processes will not require that the whole process be updated.
